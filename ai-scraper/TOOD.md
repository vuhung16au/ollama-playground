Here are some practical, not-too-complicated ways to extend your AI Scraper app for real-world use cases. Each suggestion includes a brief explanation and why it’s valuable.

## 1. **Support Multiple URLs at Once**
**What:** Allow users to input a list of URLs (or upload a CSV of URLs) and chat with the combined content.  
**Why:** Useful for comparing information across several sources, or summarizing a topic from multiple sites.

---

## 2. **File Upload Support**
**What:** Let users upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) in addition to URLs.  
**Why:** Many real-world documents aren’t on the web. This makes your app useful for internal company docs, reports, etc.

---

## 3. **Export Answers or Summaries**
**What:** Add a button to export the chat history, answers, or summaries to a text file or PDF.  
**Why:** Users may want to save or share the insights they get from the app.

---

## 4. **Persistent Storage**
**What:** Store processed documents and chat history in a simple database (like SQLite or TinyDB) so users don’t lose their work when the app restarts.  
**Why:** Makes the app more robust and user-friendly for longer sessions.

---

## 5. **Basic User Authentication**
**What:** Add a simple login system (username/password or Google login) so users can have private sessions and saved histories.  
**Why:** Useful for multi-user environments or when handling sensitive data.

---

## 6. **Topic Summarization**
**What:** Add a “Summarize this website” button that gives a concise summary of the whole page or all uploaded documents.  
**Why:** Many users want a quick overview before asking detailed questions.

---

## 7. **Keyword/Entity Extraction**
**What:** Automatically extract and display key topics, people, organizations, or dates from the scraped content.  
**Why:** Helps users quickly understand what’s important in the content.

---

## 8. **Scheduled Crawling**
**What:** Allow users to schedule regular scraping of certain URLs (e.g., daily news updates) and get notified of new content.  
**Why:** Useful for monitoring news, blogs, or competitor sites.

---

## 9. **Language Support**
**What:** Detect and process content in multiple languages, or allow users to select their preferred language for answers.  
**Why:** Expands your app’s usability to non-English content and users.

---

## 10. **Simple API Endpoint**
**What:** Expose a REST API so other apps or scripts can send URLs/questions and get answers programmatically.  
**Why:** Makes your app integratable with other tools and workflows.
