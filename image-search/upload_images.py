    1. **Click the upload area** or **drag and drop** your images

    3. **Batch upload**: Select multiple images at once
    4. **Automatic processing**: Images are analyzed and made searchable
    
    Your images will be processed and made available for:
    - **Text-based search**: Find images by describing what you're looking for
    - **Reverse image search**: Find similar images by uploading a reference image
