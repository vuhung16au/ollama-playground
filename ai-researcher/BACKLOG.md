# Implementation of a 3-Column Layout for the AI Researcher App

Current UI/UX is basic and needs enhancements:
- Only 1 (or 2) column layout

Key Improvements in this 3-Column Layout:

Left Column (25% width) - Control Panel:
    - Clean input area with better text area
    - Model selection dropdown (addresses your backlog item)
    - Logging controls (console, file, performance)
    - Quick actions (clear results, view logs)
    - Settings and configuration

Middle Column (50% width) - Main Content:
    - Prominent research results display
    - Dynamic progress tracking with visual indicators
    - Collapsible sources section
    - Welcome message when idle
    - Better typography and spacing

Right Column (25% width) - Metrics Dashboard:
    - Real-time performance metrics in cards
    - Detailed expandable metrics section
    - System information
    - Clean, organized layout

# New features to add

üìä Enhanced Metrics Dashboard
üìà Research History & Comparison
üé® Content Analysis & Insights

# Users can choose the model to use

Currently, the app uses the Deepseek model by default.

Users can select from a dropdown menu to choose different models:
