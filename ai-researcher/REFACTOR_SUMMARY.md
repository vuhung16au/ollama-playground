## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Functions can be imported where needed
3. **Testability**: Individual modules can be unit tested
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features
5. **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The application runs exactly as before:
```bash
streamlit run ai_researcher.py
```

All functionality is preserved while the codebase is now much more maintainable and extensible.
