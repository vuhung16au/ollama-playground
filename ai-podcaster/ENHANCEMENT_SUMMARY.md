# Enhanced Benchmark Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Added Metrics

### 1. Memory Usage ✅
- **Peak RAM consumption** during inference
- Tracks maximum memory usage via `psutil.Process().memory_info().rss`
- Reported in MB in both individual runs and averaged results
- Field: `peak_memory_mb`

### 2. GPU Utilization ✅  
- **GPU usage percentage** during inference (when available)
- Uses NVIDIA ML library for accurate monitoring
- Falls back gracefully on systems without GPU support
- Fields: `avg_gpu_utilization`, `max_gpu_utilization`

### 3. CPU Usage ✅
- **Average CPU utilization percentage** during inference
- Monitors process-specific CPU usage via `psutil.Process().cpu_percent()`
- Tracks both average and maximum values
- Fields: `avg_cpu_percent`, `max_cpu_percent`

### 4. Model Size ✅
- **Disk space required** for each model
- Queries Ollama API for exact model information
- Falls back to parameter-based size estimation
- Includes quantization information
- Fields: `model_size_mb`, `model_size_gb`, `parameter_count`, `quantization`

### 5. Load Time ✅
- **Time to load model into memory** before inference begins
- Measures time from request start to first response
- Important for cold-start performance analysis
- Field: `load_time_seconds`

### 6. Response Quality Score ✅
- Currently set to **"TBC"** (To Be Configured)
- Placeholder ready for future quality assessment implementation
- Field: `response_quality_score`

### 7. Relevance Score ✅
- Currently set to **"TBC"** (To Be Configured)  
- Placeholder ready for future relevance assessment implementation
- Field: `relevance_score`

## 📊 Enhanced Output Formats
