# run time metrics 

I want to 

- print the results in a log file `logs/ai_spotify.txt` 
- print run time for each step (1, 2) for each input files

# add command line options to the script to handle a whole folder of .md files or single .md file

./outputs/summaries
./outputs/audio

# break sccript into 2 steps 

our script has 2 steps 

1. summarize .md and save to .txt 
2. convert .txt to .mp3 

help me refactor to code 

- break it into 2 steps 
- have command line options to handle step 1, 2 at once or separately.

e.g 

## Run only step 1 (summarize markdown to text)
python ai_spotify.py --step 1

## Run only step 2 (convert text to MP3)
python ai_spotify.py --step 2

## Run both steps
python ai_spotify.py --step all

if --step is not specified, run both steps by default.

# Only one attempt to generate summary

pls remove `create_summary_prompt_with_length` function and related code

Shorten the following text. Your shortened text should:

- In less than {word_limit} words.
- Use clear and concise language.
- Avoid jargon and complex terminology.
- Use a friendly and engaging tone.
- Provide a response that is easy to understand for a general audience.
- Please respond in plain text only. Do not use any markdown formatting, bold text, italics, code blocks, or special characters for formatting. Just provide a simple, unformatted text response.
- IMPORTANT: Respond with PLAIN TEXT ONLY. No markdown, no formatting, no bold, no italics, no code blocks, no special characters. Just simple, clean text paragraphs.
- Do not use asterisks (*), underscores (_), backticks (`), hash symbols (#), or any other markdown syntax.
- Only respond with the shortened text, without any additional comments or explanations.
Text: {text}

"""

# strip_markdown 

Pls update `def clean_text(text):` function in `ai_spotify.py` to remove all markdown formats from the text.
Currently, it only removes some basic formats like bold and italic, but we need to remove all markdown formats manually.

Pls Use the `strip_markdown` (https://pypi.org/project/strip-markdown/) lib/function to clean the text by removing all markdown formats.

install it by running:
```
$ pip install strip_markdown
```

sample code:

```python
>>> import strip_markdown
>>>
>>> TXT: str = strip_markdown.strip_markdown(MD: str)
>>> strip_markdown.strip_markdown_file(MD_fn: str, TXT_fn: Optional[str])
```

TXT_fn is optional: default is <MD_fn>.md -> <MD_fn>.txt
If TXT_fn is a directory, <MD_fn>.txt is placed in that directory


# Add a config to disable/enalbe using of SUMMARY_WORD configs

SUMMARY_WORD_LIMIT = 1200
SUMMARY_WORD_MIN = 800

default of of this config is DISABLED.

# Better TTS model 

Currently I am using `kokoro` 80M model for text-to-speech.
suggest me an alternative model having better natural, human-like voice. 

My Top Recommendation:
Coqui XTTS v2 is your best bet because it offers:

Significantly more natural speech than Kokoro 80M
Good inference speed
Voice cloning capabilities
Active development and community support
Easy integration

## List 

1. Coqui TTS (XTTS v2)
2. Bark (Suno AI)
3. Tortoise TTS
4. Microsoft SpeechT5
5. MMS-TTS (Meta)

Recommendations Based on Use Case:

For Best Quality (Natural Human-like Voice):
Bark - Most natural with emotions
Coqui XTTS v2 - Excellent voice cloning
Tortoise TTS - Highest quality but slower

For Good Quality + Speed:
Coqui XTTS v2 - Best balance
SpeechT5 - Faster inference
MMS-TTS - Good for multilingual

For Voice Cloning/Customization:
Coqui XTTS v2 - Easiest to use
Bark - Good character voices
Tortoise TTS - Highest fidelity cloning

# Step 11 Which model? 

Currently I am using `deepseek-r1:8b` to summarise text. 

What I want to do is to reduce the text 

Input: ~5000 words 
shortened text: between 

SUMMARY_WORD_LIMIT = 2000
SUMMARY_WORD_MIN = 1000

what local LLM models (using with ollama) should I use? 

# Download and test these models:
ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b        # Upgrade from your current 8B
ollama pull llama3.2:3b            # Fast and efficient
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b             # Good balance
ollama pull smollm2:1.7b           # Most efficient

Add a CLI option to specify ollam model to use 
-m/--model "name-of-ollama-model"

# Step 7 

SUMMARY_WORD_LIMIT = 2000
SUMMARY_WORD_MIN = 1000

Make sure that the shortened text is at least 1000 words long, and no more than 2000 words long.

How to implement this code? 

# Step 6 

I want to set the response from ollama to be plaintext, not markdown. 

how to set `format` to plain text ?

``` 
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:11434/api/generate', 
    json={
        'model': 'your-model-name',
        'prompt': 'Your prompt here',
        'format': 'json',  # or omit format entirely for plain text
        'options': {
            'temperature': 0.7
        }
    }
)
``` 

# Step 5 

Improve `def clean_text(text):` 
by removing all markdown formats.

Sample code below 

```

import re

def strip_markdown(text):
    # Remove markdown formatting
    text = re.sub(r'\*\*(.*?)\*\*', r'\1', text)  # Bold
    text = re.sub(r'\*(.*?)\*', r'\1', text)      # Italic
    text = re.sub(r'`(.*?)`', r'\1', text)        # Inline code
    text = re.sub(r'```.*?```', '', text, flags=re.DOTALL)  # Code blocks
    text = re.sub(r'^#{1,6}\s', '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)  # Headers
    return text.strip()
```

# Step 3 

save audio files to `.mp3` format, instead of `.wav` 

# Step 2: bug fixing

1. save the summary in plaintext format, not markdown. 
2. don't include `</think>` in the summary, just the summary itself.

# Step 1 

# Finish `ai_spotify.py`

This is a command-line interface (CLI) script for summarizing and generating audio versions of Markdown files. The script reads Markdown files from a specified input folder, summarizes their content, and generates audio files of the summaries.

## Inputs: 

-d/--folder: The folder where input text files are located
default: inputs/data-mining-real-world-applications

the program will read all Markdown (.md) files in the specified folder

## Outputs: 

### Output folder:
-o/--output: The output file where the summary will be saved

default: outputs/data-mining-real-world-applications

### Structure of the output folder:

./outputs/summaries
./outputs/audio

### Output files:
- Summaries of each Markdown file in the specified folder will be saved as .md files in the output folder
- Audio versions of each summary will be generated and saved as .wav files in the output folder

# Techstack: 
- Similar to the previous script, this one will use the same libraries and methods for summarization and audio generation.
- Refer to sample code at `ai_podcaster_cli.py` 
`
