### Overview
Vietnam's economy has undergone a remarkable transformation since 1975, evolving from a war-torn, centrally planned economy to a dynamic, market-oriented lower middle-income country by June 2025. The Đổi Mới reforms in 1986 were pivotal, liberalizing trade, encouraging private enterprise, and attracting foreign investment, leading to sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. In 2024, the economy grew by 7.09%, with strong exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) driving performance. By 2025, Q1 GDP growth was 6.93%, and May data showed robust industrial production (9.4% increase) and a 10.5% rise in international visitors, reflecting a strong tourism rebound. However, forecasts for 2025 vary, with international estimates like the World Bank's 5.8% and OECD's 6.2% contrasting with the government's ambitious target of at least 8%, highlighting potential challenges from global trade uncertainties.

### Survey Note: Vietnam's Economic Evolution from 1975 to June 2025

Vietnam's economic landscape has undergone a profound transformation since 1975, marked by significant policy shifts, sustained growth, and integration into the global economy. This survey note provides a comprehensive analysis of Vietnam's economic journey, drawing on historical context, recent performance, and forecasts up to June 16, 2025, based on available data and expert projections.

#### Historical Context and Early Challenges (1975-1986)
Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the country faced severe economic challenges. Vietnam was one of the world's poorest nations, with a centrally planned economy heavily reliant on trade with the Soviet Union and its allies through the Comecon. The U.S. imposed a trade embargo from 1975 to 1994, further isolating Vietnam from global markets. During this period, economic performance was poor, characterized by low GDP growth, high inflation, and dependence on foreign aid, with the economy primarily agrarian and industrially underdeveloped.

#### The Đổi Mới Era and Economic Liberalization (1986-2020s)
The turning point came in 1986 with the introduction of the Đổi Mới (Renovation) policy, which marked a shift from a centralized to a "socialist-oriented market economy." This reform combined government planning with free-market incentives, encouraging private businesses, foreign investment, and trade liberalization. The impact was transformative:
- Real GDP per capita soared from less than $700 in 1986 to approximately $4,500 by 2023 (in constant 2023 dollars), as per the World Bank.
- Poverty rates plummeted, with the share of the population living below $3.65/day (2017 PPP) dropping from 14% in 2010 to less than 4% by 2023.
- Vietnam emerged as a leading agricultural exporter (e.g., rice, coffee) and a manufacturing hub, attracting significant FDI, particularly in electronics, textiles, and footwear.

The 1990s and 2000s saw gradual integration into the global economy, with Vietnam joining the World Trade Organization in 2007, further boosting exports and investment. By the 2010s, the economy continued to grow, driven by robust domestic demand and a favorable global trade environment.

#### Recent Performance (2024-2025)
In 2024, Vietnam's economy demonstrated resilience, achieving a GDP growth of 7.09%, up from 5.05% in 2023, driven by strong exports (up 14.3% to $405.53 billion) and robust FDI inflows. The fourth quarter of 2024 saw the fastest quarterly growth in over two years at 7.55%, as reported by Reuters on January 6, 2025.

By 2025, the economy maintained momentum, with Q1 GDP growth at 6.93%, slightly lower than Q4 2024 but still robust, according to Trading Economics on April 6, 2025. Detailed data for May 2025, from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), highlights:
- **Index of Industrial Production:** Increased by 9.4%, reflecting strong manufacturing activity.
- **International Visitors:** Grew by 10.5%, indicating a significant tourism rebound, as noted in ASEAN Briefing on May 12, 2025.
- **Retail Sales of Goods and Services:** Rose by 10.2%, signaling robust domestic consumption.
- **Realized Investment Capital from State Budget:** Increased by 15.3%, underscoring continued public investment.
- **Inflation:** Consumer Price Index (CPI) at 3.24% and core inflation at 3.33%, suggesting controlled price pressures.

These indicators suggest a strong start to 2025, with tourism and industrial sectors driving growth, supported by favorable domestic demand and investment.

#### Forecasts and Challenges for 2025
Looking ahead, forecasts for 2025 vary significantly, reflecting differing assumptions about global economic conditions and domestic policy effectiveness:
- **Government Target:** In February 2025, Vietnam revised its GDP growth target to at least 8%, up from 6.5%-7.0%, as reported by Reuters on February 11, 2025, with aims to reach a $500 billion economy and per capita GDP above $5,000, as per Vietnam News on May 5, 2025. This ambitious target implies maintaining high growth rates (8.2%-8.4% in remaining quarters) to compensate for the 6.93% Q1 growth, which may be challenging given external pressures.
- **International Forecasts:**
  - **World Bank:** Initially forecasted 6.8% in March 2025 (World Bank press release on March 12, 2025), but revised to 5.8% by April 2025 due to increased trade policy uncertainty, as per Vietnam Plus on April 25, 2025.
  - **OECD:** Projected 6.2% for 2025 and 6.0% for 2026, based on domestic demand and export growth, as per OECD Economic Outlook on June 3, 2025.
  - **ADB:** Expected 6.6% for 2025, as per ADB on April 2, 2025, with considerations for potential tariff impacts.
  - **IMF:** Projected a lower 5.2% growth, as per IMF country data, reflecting cautious optimism.
  - **UOB:** Maintained a 6% forecast, as per VIR on June 11, 2025.
  - **HSBC and VEPR:** Estimated 6.5% and 7.5%-8%, respectively, as per Vietnam Briefing on January 14, 2025, showing a range of optimism.

The discrepancy between the government's 8% target and international forecasts (5.2%-6.6%) highlights potential challenges, including:
- **Trade Policy Uncertainty:** Increased tariffs, particularly from the U.S., pose risks to Vietnam's export-driven economy, as noted in Reuters on April 5, 2025.
- **Geopolitical Tensions:** Global economic slowdowns and supply chain disruptions could impact manufacturing and exports.
- **Domestic Pressures:** Achieving high growth rates in remaining quarters may require sustained investment and consumption, amidst controlled inflation (CPI at 3.24% in May 2025).

#### Comparative Analysis of Forecasts
The following table summarizes key forecasts for Vietnam's GDP growth in 2025, highlighting the range of projections:

| Organization       | Forecast for 2025 (%) | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Government Target  | At least 8.0          | Revised upward in February 2025, ambitious given Q1 performance.      |
| World Bank         | 5.8                   | Revised from 6.8% in March, citing trade policy uncertainty.          |
| OECD               | 6.2                   | Based on domestic demand, June 2025 projection.                      |
| ADB                | 6.6                   | Considers potential tariff impacts, April 2025 forecast.             |
| IMF                | 5.2                   | Cautious projection, reflecting global economic risks.               |
| UOB                | 6.0                   | Maintained forecast, June 2025 update.                               |
| HSBC               | 6.5                   | January 2025 estimate, driven by exports and FDI.                    |
| VEPR               | 7.5-8.0               | Optimistic, aligns with government target, January 2025.             |

This table underscores the controversy around Vietnam's 2025 growth outlook, with the government's target significantly higher than most international estimates, reflecting differing assumptions about policy effectiveness and global conditions.

#### Conclusion
Vietnam's economy has evolved remarkably since 1975, with the Đổi Mới reforms catalyzing growth and poverty reduction. By June 2025, the economy shows strong performance, with Q1 GDP growth at 6.93% and robust May indicators, particularly in industrial production and tourism. However, achieving the government's 8% growth target for 2025 may be challenging, given international forecasts ranging from 5.2% (IMF) to 6.6% (ADB), and risks from global trade uncertainties. Vietnam remains a dynamic player in Southeast Asia, with potential for continued growth driven by domestic demand, investment, and export resilience.
