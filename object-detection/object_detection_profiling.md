| **Average** | **97.49s** | - |

## Key Findings

### 1. Performance Consistency

- The system shows **good overall consistency** with execution times typically ranging between 30-37 seconds per detection
- Standard deviation across all detections is relatively low (< 2 seconds for each image type)
- Run-to-run variance is acceptable, with most runs completing within Â±3 seconds of the average

### 2. Image-Specific Performance Patterns

- **Apple.png** is consistently the fastest to process (31.30s average)
- **Java.png** takes the longest on average (33.77s) and shows the most variability
- **Tiger.png** falls in the middle (32.41s average) with moderate consistency

### 3. Performance Trends

- **Run 1** was slightly slower (99.79s), possibly due to cold start effects
- **Runs 2, 4, and 5** showed very similar performance (~94.5s each)
- **Run 3** was the slowest (104.00s), particularly due to java.png taking 36.97s

### 4. System Stability

- No failures or errors occurred during any of the 15 detections
- All responses returned valid JSON with proper object detection results
- The llama3.2-vision model demonstrated reliable performance throughout

## Performance Insights

### Potential Performance Factors

1. **Image Complexity:** Java.png (text-heavy image) consistently takes longer to process
2. **Content Type:** Natural images (tiger, apple) process slightly faster than text-based images
3. **Model Warm-up:** First run showed slightly higher execution times
4. **System Load:** Gap between Run 3 and Run 4 (4+ minutes) didn't significantly impact performance

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Batch Processing:** Consider processing multiple images in a single API call if supported
2. **Parallel Processing:** Implement concurrent processing for multiple images
3. **Caching:** For repeated detections of the same images, implement result caching
4. **Model Optimization:** Consider using quantized models for faster inference if accuracy allows

## Conclusion

The object detection system demonstrates **reliable and consistent performance** with an average processing time of 32.5 seconds per image. The performance is well within acceptable ranges for most use cases, with good stability across multiple runs. The slight variations observed are normal for AI inference systems and don't indicate any systemic issues.

**Recommendation:** The current performance profile is suitable for production use, with opportunities for optimization if faster processing times are required.
