# Logging and Profiling Features Implementation

## Overview

The implementation includes timing profiling, detailed logging, and log file output.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Python Logging System

- **Log Configuration**: Configured Python's built-in logging module with both file and console handlers
- **Log Format**: Timestamped logs with logger name, level, and detailed messages
- **Log Levels**: INFO for normal operations, ERROR for exceptions
- **Log File Location**: `./logs/invoice_text_extractor.log`

### 2. OCR Processing Time Profiling

- **Timing Measurement**: Accurate timing using `time.time()` before and after OCR processing
- **Performance Logging**: Processing time logged for each image
- **Batch Statistics**: Average and total processing times for multiple images

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Exception Logging**: Comprehensive error logging with processing time information
- **Graceful Failures**: Proper error handling that doesn't crash the application
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Contextual error information for debugging

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation

**`invoice_ocr_processor.py`**:
- Complete object-oriented design with InvoiceExtractor class
- Comprehensive logging and profiling capabilities
- Single image and batch processing functionality
- JSON export capabilities
- Robust error handling and timing measurement
### Supporting Files

1. **`logs/` directory**:
   - Created logs directory for log file storage

2. **`LOGGING_FEATURES.md`**:
   - This documentation file

## Sample Log Output

```log
2025-06-25 15:59:16,359 - enhanced_invoice_extractor - INFO - Initialized InvoiceExtractor with model: llama3.2-vision
2025-06-25 15:59:16,359 - enhanced_invoice_extractor - INFO - Starting OCR extraction for: images/invoice-01.png
2025-06-25 15:59:20,549 - enhanced_invoice_extractor - INFO - OCR processing completed in 4.19 seconds for images/invoice-01.png
2025-06-25 15:59:20,549 - enhanced_invoice_extractor - INFO - Successfully extracted data: Invoice #INV-001, Vendor: TechCorp, Total: $750.50
2025-06-25 15:59:20,550 - enhanced_invoice_extractor - INFO - Batch processing completed: 1/1 successful extractions in 4.19 seconds
```

## Performance Metrics Example

From the demo run:
- **Processing Time**: 4.19-33.03 seconds per image (varies based on system load)
- **Log File Size**: Minimal overhead, detailed but concise logging
- **Memory Impact**: Negligible additional memory usage

## Usage Examples

### Enhanced Extractor with Batch Processing

```bash
python invoice_ocr_processor.py
```

### View Live Logs

```bash
tail -f ./logs/invoice_text_extractor.log
```

## Features Summary

✅ **Python Logging**: Complete logging system with file and console output  
✅ **OCR Timing**: Accurate processing time measurement and logging  
✅ **Log File Output**: All logs saved to `./logs/invoice_text_extractor.log`  
✅ **Performance Profiling**: Detailed timing statistics for each operation  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging with timing information  
✅ **Batch Processing**: Enhanced extractor supports multiple image processing  
✅ **Console Output**: Real-time logging to console during processing  
✅ **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format with timestamps and levels  

## Benefits

1. **Debugging**: Detailed logs help identify issues and performance bottlenecks
2. **Monitoring**: Track processing times and system performance
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all processing activities
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identify slow operations for improvement
5. **Production Ready**: Professional logging suitable for production deployment

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The logging and profiling features provide comprehensive visibility into the OCR processing pipeline, making it suitable for both development and production environments.
